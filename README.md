# T-and-T-project

Тема:Розробка моделі банкету

Cуть проекту полягає у наступному:

All we need is  food! But, unfortunately, not often we have enough time, skills or inspiration to create our own culinary masterpiece. There are also situations when we just need to feed our guests with delicious dishes, whether  it is a feast for the appointment  of a new position, an arrival of your distant relatives or a birthday of your beloved dog . In such special cases you have to use a help of our sushi-restaurant, which is sure to delight you with it’s assortment of sushi sets.
We take care of our customers, that’s why we provide a special program with which you will be able to create your perfect banquet.
How does this program work? It’s extremely easy! You will see “Food” and “Beverages” categories on your screen. In each of them you will in turn find subcategories, with which you can create desired menu. You will also need to enter the number of guests that are supposed to be at the banquet. The program will calculate a quote for a whole celebration for you. So, as you can see, the program is extremely easy to use and rather useful.
